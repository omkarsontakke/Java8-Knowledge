Day 1 – Java 8 Questions
1. When would you use map() vs flatMap() in streams?
Ans:- Suppose you have employee object, and you want to access one field then you can go with map means you want to access single entity,
      if suppose you want to access one field that contains multiple data, then you can go with the flatMap.

Give an example scenario where map() fails but flatMap() works.
    Example:
            List<String> empNames =  employeeList.stream().map(Employee::getName).toList();
            System.out.println("Names of employees: " + empNames);
            List<String> empEmails = employeeList.stream().flatMap(e -> e.getEmail().stream()).toList();
            System.out.println("Emails of employees: " + empEmails);

2. In which situation would you use Collectors.groupingBy()?
Ans:- Suppose we have the list of employee, and we want to filter the employee based on there department the can go with the groupingBy() method.

Give a real-time scenario like grouping employees by department.
    Example:
        Map<String, List<Employee>> empGrpByDept = employeeList.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment));
        System.out.println("Employee Group by Department : "+empGrpByDept);

3. When should you use Optional.of(), Optional.ofNullable(), and Optional.isEmpty()?
Ans:- Use the .of() method when you certain that value must be present else throw the NPE.
      Use the .ofNullable() method when you don't have an idea if the value coming is null or not.
      Use the .isEmpty() method when you want to check the value is holding or not
Explain scenario-based usage.

4. When do you prefer forEach() vs collect()?
Ans:- Use forEach() method for perform the operation on the list
      Use collect() method for returning the new list after the operation.
Explain when modifying existing list vs creating a  ew transformed list is required.
 Example:
    employeeList.stream().map(Employee::getName).forEach(e -> System.out.println(e.toUpperCase()));
    List<String> collectMethodUse = employeeList.stream().map(Employee::getDepartment).collect(Collectors.toList());
    System.out.println(collectMethodUse);

5. When should you use parallelStream() instead of stream()?
Ans:- When you want to use multiple core of the CPU for performing the task use the parallelStream(). and you want the fast response
Give a situation where using parallelStream() actually improves performance.
