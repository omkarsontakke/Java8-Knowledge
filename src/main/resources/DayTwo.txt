1. When should you use filter() before map() and when should you use map() before filter()?
Ans:- So basically we use the filter when you want the data on specific condition, and we use the map when you want to perform the task on each element.
    use filter() before map -> when you want to perform some condition if it is satisfied then only you want to apply some logic

    Use Map before filter() ->  When filtering depends on the transformed value.

2. In which situation would you use peek()?
Ans:- peek method is used when you filter the data on that filter data you want to perform any operation.
      like we have to increase the salary of the employee whose employee rating is greater than 3

      Use peak() when you want to debug/logging the code .

    Explain why peek() should not be used to modify data and when it is safe to use it.
    - coz it breaks the rule of functional programming
    - Hard for debugging


3. When should you use reduce()?
Ans:- So reduce method is used to perform some mathematically operation, like you want the sum of expense done by employee
    Give a real example where collect() does not help but reduce() is the correct solution.
    - When you want to find the total salary of the employees.

4. When should you use Comparator.comparing() vs thenComparing()?
Ans:- When you want the sorted data based on the salary, and if salary is also same then sort based on the name of the employee.
Give a scenario where sorting requires:

    primary key
    -No idea
    secondary key
    -No idea

Example: sort employees by salary, then by name.
    List<Employee> sortThaSal = employeeList.stream()
                    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary)
                            .thenComparing(Employee::getName)).toList();

5. When should you use Collectors.toMap() and when does it throw an exception?
Ans:- When you want to create the map on the basis of the list or object.
Explain:

duplicate keys
=> (oldValue, newValue) -> newValue
