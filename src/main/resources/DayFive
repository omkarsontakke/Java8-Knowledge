1. When should you use distinct() and when will it fail?

    Give a scenario where distinct() does not remove duplicates because your custom class does not implement equals() and hashCode().

2. When should you use skip() and limit()?

    Give a real scenario such as pagination where these two methods make sense together.

3. When should you use Stream.builder()?

    Explain with a scenario where you need to build a stream conditionally, adding elements only if certain conditions are true.

4. When should you use Collectors.counting() vs stream().count()?

    Give a scenario where collecting with counting is required instead of using .count() directly.

5. When should you use flatMap() on a Map<Key, List<Value>>?

    Give a scenario where you want:

    A single list of all values

    Or you want to process values across all keys in one shot
