1. When should you use mapToInt(), mapToLong(), or mapToDouble() instead of map()?
Ans:- When you don't want an Object in a stream then go with the primitive type like above functions.

    Give a scenario where using primitive streams makes the code faster and reduces memory usage.
        - Suppose you have 10k of employees and you want the sum of the salary of of total emp,
          so if you used map then its become the slower, use the primitive methods it is fast


2. When should you use Collectors.joining()?

    Explain a real-case where you need to produce a comma-separated or JSON-like string from a list of Objects.

3. When is Stream.generate() useful and what danger should you avoid?

    Give a scenario where you need an infinite stream, and explain why you must always use .limit() with it.

4. What is the difference between sorted() and sorted(Comparator)?

    Give a scenario where natural sorting fails and you must provide a comparator.

5. When should you use Stream.concat()?

    Give a scenario where you need to merge two lists or two streams, and explain the performance impact.
