DNS Server -> Global public Directory, that stored the value in key-value(amazon.com -> 10.2.3.4);

What is Fault Tolerance?
a system's ability to continue operating without interruption even if one or more components fail.


Types of scaling : Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling.

1.Vertical Scaling:
	We are increasing resource/capacity of the system like increasing the CPU, RAM, Processor, etc. in one system.
	Drawback: DownTime -> We can not do VS in running machine, coz we have to restart after adding the resources
2.Horizontal Scaling:
	In this we use the multiple server instead of reading resource to at one server.
	If the traffic is increase we will simultaneously increase the server.
	Issue: how user know the which server we have to req?
		Sol: Use the load balance(Server) that send or distribute the req to multiple servers. In amazon term we call it as ELB(Elastic Load Balance)
		Note: we give the LB ip to the DNS. also LB check the health of server that manage the traffic/load to scale.
	Sometimes LB also down, bt amazon ELB its has the include micro machine, multiple threads and workers are there they can efficiently handle

SQS -> Simple Queue System , SQS uses the PULL machine (It is ONE:ONE)
In this 2 terms are there, One is Push mechanism and second is pull
In pull mechanism the worker/other microservice will pull the req from the Queue system.(In this some specific timeworker/ms will ask the queue that you have any req?)
In Push mechanism the Queue system will the push/ send the req to the microservice


PUB/SUB Model : (It is ONE:MANY) It uses the event-driven architecture.
	When to use: When you want to do multiple task when event is trigger
		Example: When payment is done, You have to send Email(User,Vendor),SMS,etc
	Drawback: It is not giving acknowledgment
		
SNS(Simple Notification Service) :
	In this case all microservice will lesson to the SNS, If new event is trigger its notified the all microservices that listen the SNS.
	

FANOUT Architecture:
	It uses the PUB/SUB and SQS Internally.

Rate Limiting : How to req you send in given time of point.
	Types of Rate Limiting Strategies
	1.Leaky Bucket
	2.Token Bucket
